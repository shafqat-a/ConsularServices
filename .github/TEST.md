# Testing the Auto-Approval System

## Workflow Validation

### YAML Syntax Check
```bash
yamllint .github/workflows/auto-approve-prs.yml
```
✅ Passes yamllint validation

### Workflow Components Verification
The workflow includes all required components:
- ✅ Proper trigger events (opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review)
- ✅ Correct permissions (pull-requests: write, contents: read)
- ✅ Draft check condition (github.event.pull_request.draft == false)
- ✅ Trusted action (hmarr/auto-approve-action@v4)
- ✅ Proper authentication (GITHUB_TOKEN)
- ✅ Descriptive review message

### Expected Behavior
When this workflow is active:
1. ✅ Draft PRs will NOT be auto-approved
2. ✅ Non-draft PRs will be automatically approved
3. ✅ Approval will include a descriptive message
4. ✅ Only triggers on relevant PR events

### Manual Testing Plan
To test the system after deployment:
1. Create a draft PR → Should NOT be approved
2. Mark draft PR as ready for review → Should be approved
3. Create a non-draft PR → Should be approved immediately
4. Push changes to existing PR → Should be approved again
