# Installing MCP server for file operations in VS Code (2025-08-17 00:45Z)

_**User**_

I want enhance my vscode with MCP servers. First mcp server I need that can read and write files and run scripts. Can you help me install that

_**Assistant**_

Reading your Claude desktop config then scaffolding the MCP server. Creating a new MCP file/shell server and updating config. Updating Claude desktop config to add new server entry. Adding new MCP server config entry and fixing pyproject packaging. 
```

```

```

```
Installing the new MCP server in editable mode. Setting up a virtual environment for the MCP server then reinstalling. Testing the server initialize call manually via python to ensure it responds. **Done**  
- Added new MCP server `file-shell` (read/write/append files + run shell commands).  
- Created package in `` with runnable `server.py`.  
- Updated Claude desktop config to register it.  
- Verified initialize handshake works.

**Files Added/Changed**  
- `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621)  
- `server.py` (stdio JSON line protocol)  
- `README.md`  
- `__init__.py`  
- Updated `claude_desktop_config.json` to include server.  
- Created local venv at `` and installed package editable.

**How It Works**  
- Claude (or any MCP-capable client using the simple JSON line pattern) launches:  
  Command: `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 `server.py` --stdio --root /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices`  
- Server replies to `initialize` with tool metadata.  
- Tool call request shape (one line JSON):  
  `{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"file_read","arguments":{"path":"README.md"}}}`  
- Response contains `result` or `error`.

**Available Tools**  
- `file_read`: `{path}` → returns `{path, content}`  
- `file_write`: `{path, content, overwrite?}` → writes file  
- `file_append`: `{path, content}` → appends or creates  
- `run`: `{command, cwd?, timeout?}` → runs non-interactive shell, captures stdout/stderr (truncated to last 10k chars)

**Local Manual Test (optional)**  
```bash
python /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices/file-shell-mcp/file_shell_mcp/server.py --stdio --root /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices <<'EOF'
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize"}
{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"run","arguments":{"command":"echo hello"}}}
EOF
```

**Claude Desktop Reload**  
- If Claude Desktop was open while editing config, restart it (or toggle MCP servers in its settings) to load `file-shell`.  
- You should then see the tools exposed under the server name.

**Security Notes**  
- `run` currently allows any command inside the root tree; consider restricting: allowlist commands, drop environment, or disable chaining (`;`, `&&`) by only accepting list-form commands.  
- `safe_join` blocks path traversal outside root.  
- Password for `mikrotik` is in plain text—consider moving to environment variable and referencing it.

**Optional Next Enhancements**  
- Add `list_dir` tool (with depth / glob).  
- Add `delete` / `rename` tools.  
- Add execution allowlist and extension filters.  
- Stream output for long-running tasks (current version buffers).  
- Switch config to use the venv python: `python`.

Let me know if you’d like me to (a) tighten security, (b) add more tools, or (c) switch to a Node or Rust implementation. Want to proceed with any of those?

_**User**_

Can you make these mcp server avialable for this user rather than this project only

---

_**Assistant**_

Checking for pipx and installing globally accessible file-shell-mcp via pipx. Installing file-shell-mcp as a user-wide executable via pipx. Updating config to reference the pipx installed entry point instead of project path python. Patching config so file-shell uses pipx shim and a generic root env variable. 
```

```
**Updated Goal**  
Make the MCP servers user-wide (not tied to the ConsularServices repo).

**What I Did**  
- Installed `pipx` (gives isolated, user-level Python app environments).
- Installed your new server globally via `pipx install /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices/file-shell-mcp` so the executable `` is now at `~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp` (on PATH for your user).
- Updated `claude_desktop_config.json` so the `file-shell` server uses the pipx-provided command instead of a project-local Python path.
- Introduced env var `MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT` so you can point the server at any root directory without editing the config (default set to your home directory). You can override per session by exporting a different value before launching Claude.

**Current Config Snippet (file-shell)**  
Command: `~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp`  
Args: `--stdio --root $MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT`  
Env: `MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT=/Users/shafqat`

**Change Root Dynamically**  
Before starting Claude (or restarting it):
```zsh
export MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT=/Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices
open -a \"Claude\"   # or restart the app normally
```
Or point it somewhere else:
```zsh
export MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT=$HOME/projects/another-repo
```

**Optional Hardening / Improvements** (ask if you want any of these and I can implement):
- Add allowlist for commands in `run`.
- Add `list_dir`, `delete_file`, `rename_file` tools.
- Add size / binary file guard for reads.
- Add logging with a `--log` flag.
- Add per-call working directory sandbox (relative only).
- Package & publish to PyPI for easier install (`pipx install file-shell-mcp`).

**Next Suggestions**  
Let me know if you’d like:
1. Security tightening (allowlist).
2. Extra file management tools.
3. A second MCP server (e.g., Git operations or SQLite).
4. Converting mikrotik credentials to env vars.

Just tell me which (or something else) and I’ll proceed. Want to add any of these now?

_**User**_

question - how to start the mcp servers such as mikrotik

---

_**Assistant**_

**Request**  
How to start (launch/use) the MCP servers (`mikrotik` and `file-shell`).

**Quick Answer**  
For Claude Desktop: just (re)start the Claude app — it auto-launches every server listed in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` with their `command` + `args`.  
Manual testing: run the listed commands directly in a terminal and send JSON lines over stdin.

**1. Locate Current Config**  
File: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
Servers defined under `mcpServers.mikrotik` and `mcpServers.file-shell`.

**2. Start Via Claude Desktop (Normal Use)**  
- Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q).  
- (Optional) Adjust environment variables first, e.g.:
```zsh
export MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT=$HOME/git/ConsularServices   # or any directory you want as root
```
- Launch Claude again (Dock / Spotlight / `open -a "Claude"`).  
Claude will spawn each server and negotiate `initialize`. Tools then appear in the UI.

**3. Manual Start / Debug (mikrotik)**  
Command (as defined):
```zsh
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 \
  /Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py \
  --host 192.168.0.2 \
  --username mcp \
  --password 'Orion123@987' \
  --port 8728
```
If it expects stdio JSON-RPC lines, you can test (example using a here-doc if it’s line JSON):
```zsh
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py ...args... <<'EOF'
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize"}
EOF
```
(Replace with real protocol if it differs—some MCP servers auto-output first.)

**4. Manual Start / Debug (file-shell)**  
Using the pipx-installed script:
```zsh
~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp --stdio --root "$MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT"
```
(or without env var:)
```zsh
~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp --stdio --root /Users/shafqat
```
Then interact:
```zsh
~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp --stdio --root "$PWD" <<'EOF'
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize"}
{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"run","arguments":{"command":"echo hi"}}}
EOF
```

**5. Verifying They’re Running (Claude Desktop)**  
- Open Claude → open tools panel (if available) → you should see server names.  
- If not: confirm config JSON syntax (no trailing commas), then restart Claude.  
- Check system logs (Console app) for spawn errors if still absent.

**6. Changing the File Root Dynamically**  
Before launching Claude:
```zsh
export MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT=$HOME/projects/another-root
open -a "Claude"
```
To persist, add the export line to `~/.zshrc` (only if you always want that root).

**7. Improving Security (Optional)**  
- Move mikrotik password to env var:
  - In config replace `--password`, put e.g. `$MIKROTIK_PASS`
  - Export before launch:
```zsh
export MIKROTIK_PASS='yourSecret'
```
- Or remove password from args and let server read from env internally (would require code change).

**8. Common Troubleshooting**  
- Tools not appearing: restart Claude; validate JSON; ensure executable path exists.
- Permission errors on file operations: adjust `MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT` to a writable directory.
- Network issues with mikrotik: test connectivity:
```zsh
nc -vz 192.168.0.2 8728
```
- PATH issues: ensure `~/.local/bin` is in PATH:
```zsh
echo $PATH | grep -q "$HOME/.local/bin" || echo 'Add export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH to ~/.zshrc'
```

**9. Optional Helper Alias**  
Add to `~/.zshrc` for quick manual test:
```zsh
alias mcp-file-shell-test='~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp --stdio --root ${MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT:-$PWD}'
```

**10. Next Enhancements (I can implement if you want)**  
- Add listing/deleting tools.  
- Add command allowlist.  
- Convert mikrotik creds to env var usage in code.  
- Logging verbosity flags.

Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with any of those improvements or set up another MCP server (e.g., Git or SQLite). What’s next?

_**User**_

Lets forget claude-desktop. I want to do all via vscode

---

_**Assistant**_

Scaffolding a VS Code extension in the repo to run MCP servers directly. Creating the extension directory and reapplying scaffold files sequentially. 

---

_**User**_

I need to run the MCP servers from VS Code and VSCode already can run a few mcp servers. VSCode has >MCP Servers command

---

_**Assistant**_

**Goal**  
Run your existing MCP servers (`file-shell`, `mikrotik`) using VS Code’s built‑in MCP support (Command Palette: “MCP Servers”).

**Checklist**  
- Identify which VS Code extension is providing “MCP Servers” (likely Claude / Anthropic).  
- Open settings JSON and add server definitions.  
- Use secure env vars (avoid plaintext password).  
- Verify servers start via Command Palette.  
- Test a tool call (read/write, run, etc.).  
- (Optional) Add global wrapper scripts if paths are long.

**1. Find / Open the MCP Servers Config**  
In VS Code:  
1. Press Cmd+Shift+P → type: Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)  
2. Look for an object setting like one of:  
   - `claude.mcpServers` (most likely)  
   - `mcp.servers` (some builds)  
If unsure, open Extensions panel → find the Claude (or MCP) extension → Settings → search “mcp”.

**2. Add Server Entries (Settings JSON)**  
Example (adjust the exact root key to what your extension expects—replace `claude.mcpServers` if different):

```jsonc
{
  "claude.mcpServers": {
    "file-shell": {
      "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--stdio",
        "--root", "${workspaceFolder}"
      ],
      "env": {
      }
    },
    "mikrotik": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/python3",
      "args": [
        "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py",
        "--host", "192.168.0.2",
        "--username", "mcp",
        "--password", "${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}",
        "--port", "8728"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:  
- `${workspaceFolder}` lets you scope `file-shell` root to the currently opened project.  
- `${env:VAR_NAME}` pulls from your shell environment; set `MIKROTIK_PASS` instead of hardcoding.  

**3. Set Environment Variable Securely**  
In your shell init (`~/.zshrc` or just per-session before launching VS Code):  
```zsh
export MIKROTIK_PASS='Orion123@987'
```
Then start VS Code from that shell so the extension inherits env:  
```zsh
code .
```

**4. Start / Manage Servers**  
- Cmd+Shift+P → “MCP Servers: List” or “MCP Servers: Start All” (exact phrasing may differ; look for “MCP”).  
- You should see both `file-shell` and `mikrotik`.  
- Use the palette entry “MCP Servers: Restart” if you change config.

**5. Test Tool Invocation**  
After start, open the MCP panel (if provided) or use:  
- “MCP: Call Tool” (choose `file-shell`, then e.g. `run`, argument: `echo hello`).  
If no UI, you can manually trigger via whichever command the extension exposes (some show a tree view, others allow inline chat references like:  
“Use tool file-shell/run {\"command\":\"echo hi\"}” (depends on extension interface).

**6. Verifying / Debugging**  
- If a server doesn’t appear: check Output panel (View → Output → select “Claude” / “MCP”).  
- Confirm executable paths exist:  
  ```zsh
  ls -l /Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp
  ```
- If password not picked up: confirm env in VS Code (open an integrated terminal and run `echo $MIKROTIK_PASS`).

**7. Optional Improvements**  
- Limit `file-shell` root to read-only by adding a future flag (would need code change).  
- Create a wrapper script for mikrotik to centralize flags:  
  `/usr/local/bin/mikrotik-mcp-wrapper`:
  ```zsh
  #!/usr/bin/env zsh
  exec /opt/homebrew/bin/python3 /Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py \
    --host 192.168.0.2 --username mcp --password "${MIKROTIK_PASS}" --port 8728
  ```
  Then config just uses `"command": "/usr/local/bin/mikrotik-mcp-wrapper"` with no args.

**8. Multiple Workspaces**  
- Because `file-shell` uses `${workspaceFolder}`, each VS Code workspace you open can reuse the same settings entry and gets a sandbox relative to that root automatically.

**9. If Setting Key Differs**  
If `claude.mcpServers` is not recognized:  
- Add the config, reload window (Cmd+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window).  
- If still ignored, open the extension’s CHANGELOG / README for the exact key name, or tell me the extension’s name & version and I can tailor it precisely.

**10. Quick Command Recap**  
Set env + launch VS Code:  
```zsh
export MIKROTIK_PASS='Orion123@987'
code /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices
```
(Then use Command Palette: “MCP Servers: Start All”)

**Next Actions I Can Take (tell me which you want)**  
- Adjust `file-shell` server to support a `list_dir` tool and auto-expose it.  
- Add a safer allowlist for `run`.  
- Provide a ready wrapper script for mikrotik.  
- Help detect the exact settings key if the above doesn’t work.

Let me know if you want any of those or if the servers appear correctly now. What should we do next?

**Understanding**  
You now have native MCP commands in VS Code (seen in the palette). You want to hook your two servers (`file-shell`, `mikrotik`) into that system (not Claude Desktop) and run/use them there.

**Checklist**  
- Open correct MCP config (User vs Workspace).  
- Add both server definitions.  
- Use secure env var for Mikrotik password.  
- Trust servers (Account trust command).  
- Start & verify via “MCP: List Servers”.  
- Invoke tools (file read / run etc.).  
- Optional: workspace‑scoped root for file-shell.

**1. Open the MCP Configuration**  
You can do this two ways:  
- Command Palette → “MCP: Open User Configuration” (global)  
- Command Palette → “MCP: Open Workspace Folder MCP Configuration” (scoped to this repo)

Pick User for global availability, Workspace if you want `file-shell` root bound per project.

**2. Add Server Definitions**  
In the JSON config that opens, add (or merge) something like (adjust key if a wrapper object already exists; many implementations accept the plain object form):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-shell": {
      "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",
      "args": ["--stdio", "--root", "${workspaceFolder}"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "mikrotik": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/python3",
      "args": [
        "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py",
        "--host", "192..0.2",
        "--username", "mcp",
        "--password", "${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}",
        "--port", "8728"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the config already has another structure (e.g., just an object of servers without a `mcpServers` wrapper), mirror the existing pattern—look at any example that appears when you use “MCP: Add Server...”.

**3. Set Environment Variable (Before Launching VS Code)**  
Launch VS Code from a terminal where the secret is exported so the extension inherits it:
```zsh
export MIKROTIK_PASS='Orion123@987'
code /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices
```
To persist, add the export line to `~/.zshrc` (omit quotes on production systems if you rotate secrets via a manager).

**4. Trust the Servers**  
Command Palette → “Accounts: Manage Trusted MCP Servers For Account”  
- Locate `file-shell` and `mikrotik`, mark them as trusted.  
Untrusted servers usually won’t auto-start or expose tools.

**5. Start / Verify**  
- Command Palette → “MCP: List Servers” (shows status: running / stopped / error).  
- If not started automatically: “MCP: Browse Servers” or “MCP: Add Server...” (some implementations start on first browse) or a “Start” icon in Servers view.  
- Use “MCP: Show Installed Servers” if present to confirm registration.

**6. Invoke Tools**  
Depending on the extension UI:  
- Use “MCP: Browse Servers” → expand `file-shell` → select a tool (e.g., `run`) → fill arguments.  
- Or in chat with Copilot (if integrated):  
  Example prompt:  
  Use tool file-shell/run {"command":"echo hello"}  
  Use tool file-shell/file_write {"path":"TEST.txt","content":"hi"}  
Exact syntax may vary; the UI often provides a form when you click a tool.

**7. Typical File-Shell Tool Calls**  
- Run command: `{"command":"ls -1"}`  
- Read file: `{"path":"README.md"}`  
- Write file (overwrite default true): `{"path":"NEW.txt","content":"sample"}`

**8. Updating Roots Per Workspace**  
Workspace configuration file (opened via “MCP: Open Workspace Folder MCP Configuration”) can override just `file-shell`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "file-shell": {
      "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",
      "args": ["--stdio", "--root", "${workspaceFolder}"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
This lets global config hold `mikrotik` while each project customizes `file-shell` root.

**9. Troubleshooting**  
- Server missing: Re-run “MCP: Reset Cached Tools” then “MCP: List Servers”.  
- Permission denied: Ensure `` is executable: `ls -l ~/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp`.  
- Env var not picked up: Open a new VS Code terminal; run `echo $MIKROTIK_PASS`. If empty, you launched VS Code from GUI without the exported env—start from terminal or use launchd env injection.  
- JSON parse errors: View Output panel (select an MCP / Copilot channel) for raw lines.

**10. Optional Hardening**  
- Replace password arg with env only (server could read `os.environ['MIKROTIK_PASS']` if you modify its code to omit `--password`).  
- Add allowlist to `run` tool (ask if you want implementation).  
- Limit root to read-only actions by removing `file_write` / `file_append` tools in production.

**11. Quick Command Summary**  
```zsh
# In a terminal before VS Code
export MIKROTIK_PASS='Orion123@987'
code /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices

# In VS Code
# 1. MCP: Open User Configuration -> add JSON
# 2. Accounts: Manage Trusted MCP Servers For Account -> trust both
# 3. MCP: List Servers (verify running)
# 4. MCP: Browse Servers / Call tools
```

**Next Help Offer**  
I can:  
- Implement allowlist & extra tools (list_dir, delete) in `file-shell`.  
- Refactor mikrotik server to read password from env only.  
- Provide script to auto-launch VS Code with secrets securely (macOS keychain).  

Which enhancement do you want next?

_**User**_

It shows inly github in trusted



---

_**Assistant**_

**Cause**  
Your `file-shell` and `mikrotik` entries aren’t showing in the Trust dialog because their definitions are missing the required `"type": "stdio"` field (the Playwright one has it). Without the type, the MCP host (Copilot/VS Code) doesn’t register them, so only `github` appears.

**Fix Checklist**  
- Add `"type": "stdio"` to both custom servers.  
- Remove plaintext password; switch to env var.  
- Reload VS Code (or “Developer: Reload Window”).  
- Trigger discovery (“MCP: Browse Servers” or “MCP: List Servers”).  
- Open “Accounts: Manage Trusted MCP Servers For Account” again and trust them.  
- Reset cached tools if still absent.

**Corrected `mcp.json` Example**  
(Located at `~/Library/Application Support/Code - Insiders/User/mcp.json` — adapt if using stable build path.)

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
      // (GitHub server often remote / websocket; leave as given)
    },
    "file-shell": {
      "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",
      "args": ["--stdio", "--root", "${workspaceFolder}"],
      "env": {},
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "mikrotik": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/python3",
      "args": [
        "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py",
        "--host", "192.168.0.2",
        "--username", "mcp",
        "--password", "${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}",
        "--port", "8728"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src"
      },
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  },
  "inputs": []
}
```

**Set Secret Env Var Before Launching VS Code**  
(So `${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}` resolves.)

```zsh
export MIKROTIK_PASS='Orion123@987'
code-insiders /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices
```

If you normally start VS Code from Dock (which won’t inherit shell exports), either:  
- Launch from terminal as above, or  
- Add to `~/.zshrc` (less secure), or  
- Use macOS Keychain + a small wrapper script (I can show this if you want).

**After Editing Config**  
1. Save `mcp.json`.  
2. Command Palette: “Developer: Reload Window”.  
3. Command Palette: “MCP: Browse Servers” (forces initialization).  
4. Command Palette: “Accounts: Manage Trusted MCP Servers For Account” → check `file-shell` and `mikrotik` → OK.  
5. “MCP: List Servers” should now show them (status Running/Stopped).  
6. If tools don’t load: run “MCP: Reset Cached Tools” then “MCP: List Servers”.

**Verify Paths**  
From an integrated terminal in VS Code:

```zsh
command -v file-shell-mcp
ls -l /Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py
```

If `` isn’t found, add this to PATH (in your shell init):

```zsh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**Troubleshooting**  
- Still not listed: Confirm JSON is valid (Problems panel).  
- Check Output panel (View → Output → select Copilot/MCP channel) for start errors.  
- Ensure no trailing commas in JSON.  
- If `${workspaceFolder}` is empty (e.g., no folder open), the arg resolves to `""`; open the folder first.

**Optional Next Steps** (tell me which you’d like)  
- Add `list_dir`, `delete_file`, `rename_file` tools to `file-shell`.  
- Add command allowlist / blocklist (security).  
- Convert mikrotik server code to read password only from env (omit `--password` entirely).  
- Provide secure Keychain-based wrapper script for the password.

Let me know if you want me to patch `mcp.json` automatically or extend the `file-shell` server with more tools. What’s next?

All these servers need venev activate. How to do that

---

_**Assistant**_

**Plan**  
- Explain why you usually do NOT need to “activate” a venv for MCP servers.  
- Show 3 practical patterns to run each server with its own Python environment.  
- Provide concrete commands to create venvs.  
- Give updated `mcp.json` snippets for each pattern.  
- Cover secrets + PATH considerations.  
- Offer optional wrapper script / pipx approach.

**Key Points**  
- “Activation” only adjusts PATH/vars in an interactive shell; MCP host just execs your `command`.  
- Easiest: point `command` directly at the venv’s Python (or an entry-point script) – no activation step required.  
- Alternative: use `pipx` (already done for `file-shell`) or a wrapper script.

**Patterns**

1. Direct venv interpreter (recommended)  
   Create a dedicated venv per server under `~/.venvs/<name>` and call its `python` directly.  
2. Module invocation via venv Python (`python -m package.server ...`).  
3. Wrapper script that activates then execs (only if you need activation side-effects—rare).  
4. pipx (already isolates; activation unnecessary).

---

**1. Create Virtual Environments**

```zsh
# Make a directory for all your MCP venvs (one time)
mkdir -p ~/.venvs

# Mikrotik server venv
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp
~/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp/bin/python -m pip install -U pip

# Install your mikrotik server (adjust if it has requirements file)
~/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp/bin/python -m pip install -e /Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp

# (Optional) file-shell as venv alternative to pipx (you already used pipx)
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/file-shell-mcp
~/.venvs/file-shell-mcp/bin/python -m pip install -U pip
~/.venvs/file-shell-mcp/bin/python -m pip install -e /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices/file-shell-mcp
```

(You can skip the file-shell steps since pipx is already handling it.)

---

**2. Reference Venv Python in `mcp.json` (No Activation Needed)**

```jsonc
{
  "servers": {
    "file-shell": {
      "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",   // pipx script; OK as-is
      "args": ["--stdio", "--root", "${workspaceFolder}"],
      "env": {},
      "type": "stdio"
    },
    "mikrotik": {
      "command": "/Users/shafqat/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py",
        "--host", "192.168.0.2",
        "--username", "mcp",
        "--password", "${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}",
        "--port", "8728"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src"
      },
      "type": "stdio"
    }
  },
  "inputs": []
}
```

(After editing: Developer: Reload Window → MCP: Browse Servers → trust the new ones.)

---

**3. Using Module Invocation (Optional Style)**

```jsonc
"mikrotik": {
  "command": "/Users/shafqat/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp/bin/python",
  "args": ["-m", "mcp_mikrotik.server",
           "--host","192.168.0.2",
           "--username","mcp",
           "--password","${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}",
           "--port","8728"],
  "env": {},
  "type": "stdio"
}
```

This relies on the package being installed editable (so Python can find `mcp_mikrotik`).

---

**4. Wrapper Script (Only If You Really Want “activation”)**

Create `~/bin/mikrotik-mcp.sh`:

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
source /Users/shafqat/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp/bin/activate
exec python /Users/shafqat/git/mikrotik-mcp/src/mcp_mikrotik/server.py "$@"
```

Make executable:

```zsh
chmod +x ~/bin/mikrotik-mcp.sh
```

Then in `mcp.json`:

```jsonc
"mikrotik": {
  "command": "/Users/shafqat/bin/mikrotik-mcp.sh",
  "args": ["--host","192.168.0.2","--username","mcp","--password","${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}","--port","8728"],
  "type": "stdio"
}
```

But again: unnecessary unless activation sets special vars.

---

**5. Secrets Handling**

Export once in the shell before launching VS Code (or use macOS Keychain wrapper):

```zsh
export MIKROTIK_PASS='Orion123@987'
code-insiders .
```

If launching from Dock (no exported env), you can:
- Add to `~/.zshrc` (less secure), or
- Use a wrapper script to start VS Code after exporting, or
- Use a credential store + small Python snippet to read secret (ask if you want details).

---

**6. Confirm Server Using Correct Python**

Inside integrated terminal after server starts:

```zsh
ps -o pid,command -p $(pgrep -f mikrotik-mcp | head -1)
# Or add a debug tool to print sys.executable in the server code.
```

---

**7. Summary of Recommended Setup**

- Keep `file-shell` via pipx (already isolated).  
- Create venv under `~/.venvs/mikrotik-mcp` and point `command` at its `python`.  
- No activation required; just direct path usage.  
- Use `${env:MIKROTIK_PASS}` for password; export before launching VS Code.

---

**Common Pitfalls**

- Editing `mcp.json` but forgetting to reload window → servers not refreshed.  
- Typos in path to venv python → server never appears (check Output panel).  
- Forgetting `"type": "stdio"` → server not registered.  
- Not exporting secret → password literal `${env:...}` remains empty causing auth failure.

---

**Optional Next Enhancements (tell me if you want any)**  
- Remove `--password` flag and modify server code to read `MIKROTIK_PASS` directly (eliminates it from process args list).  
- Add more tools (`list_dir`, `delete_file`, `rename_file`) to `file-shell`.  
- Add command allowlist for `run`.  
- Keychain integration script for secret injection.

Let me know which enhancement you’d like next, or if you want me to produce a patch for removing `--password`. What should we do now?

File shell is not starting

_**Assistant**_

**Issue**  
file-shell server fails before launch with: Variable workspaceFolder can not be resolved. Please open a folder.  
This means VS Code tried to substitute `${workspaceFolder}` in your MCP config, but the current VS Code window has no workspace (no folder opened), so it aborts launching the server.

**Fix Options**  
Pick ONE of these (most people use #1 or #2):

1. Open a Folder (Recommended)  
   - File > Open Folder… → select `` (or any project root).  
   - Or from terminal:  
     ```zsh
     code-insiders /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices
     ```  
   - Then run “MCP: List Servers” again. `${workspaceFolder}` will resolve and server should start.

2. Hardcode a Root Path  
   Edit `mcp.json` entry:  
   ```jsonc
   "file-shell": {
     "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",
     "args": ["--stdio", "--root", "/Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices"],
     "env": {},
     "type": "stdio"
   }
   ```
   Save → Developer: Reload Window → Start server.

3. Use Environment Variable (Flexible, no need for an open folder)  
   - Set an env var before launching VS Code:  
     ```zsh
     export MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT=/Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices
     code-insiders .
     ```  
   - Change config:  
     ```jsonc
     "file-shell": {
       "command": "/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp",
       "args": ["--stdio", "--root", "${env:MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT}"],
       "env": {},
       "type": "stdio"
     }
     ```
   - If the env var is missing when VS Code starts, it may still fail—ensure you launch from that shell.

4. Provide a Wrapper Script (If you frequently change roots)  
   Create `~/bin/file-shell-mcp-wrapper`:
   ```zsh
   #!/usr/bin/env zsh
   ROOT_DIR=${MCP_FILE_SHELL_ROOT:-$HOME}
   exec /Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp --stdio --root "$ROOT_DIR"
   ```  
   Make executable:  
   ```zsh
   chmod +x ~/bin/file-shell-mcp-wrapper
   ```  
   Update config:  
   ```jsonc
   "file-shell": {
     "command": "/Users/shafqat/bin/file-shell-mcp-wrapper",
     "type": "stdio"
   }
   ```

**Verify Manually**  
Before relying on VS Code, run the exact command to confirm it works:
```zsh
/Users/shafqat/.local/bin/file-shell-mcp --stdio --root /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices <<'EOF'
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize"}
EOF
```
You should see a JSON line with the tools list.

**After Changing Config**  
1. Save `mcp.json`.  
2. Command Palette: Developer: Reload Window.  
3. MCP: List Servers → should show file-shell (start if needed).  
4. Trust it if prompted (Accounts: Manage Trusted MCP Servers).

**Common Pitfalls**  
- Opening only a single file (no folder) → `${workspaceFolder}` unresolved.  
- Launching VS Code from Dock (no env vars for option #3) → use terminal launch.  
- Typo in path to root or command → check Output panel’s MCP/Copilot channel.

**Security Note**  
If you change root to your home directory, all tools (read/write/run) gain wide access. Prefer limiting to a project folder.

**Next Optional Improvements**  
- Add directory listing tool.  
- Add safe allowlist for run commands.  
- Remove mikrotik password arg (switch fully to env).  
- Add fallback logic to server code so `--root` can be omitted.

Let me know which improvement you’d like next or if the server starts after applying one of the fixes. Which option did you choose / do you want help applying?
