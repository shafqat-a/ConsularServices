# Async function not executing in JavaScript code (2025-08-02 20:29Z)

_**User**_

why does this code not execute
console.log("Initializing...");
        await initRunner(pages[urlLastPartFromLocation].actions.init);

---

_**Assistant**_

The code you've highlighted is inside an `async` arrow function that is defined but never called.

In your file `FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web/www/js/admin.js`, you have the following structure:

```javascript
// ...existing code...
   (async () => {
        console.log("Initializing...");
        await initRunner(pages[urlLastPartFromLocation].actions.init);
   }) 

    
});
```

To make it an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) and execute the code inside, you need to add parentheses `()` at the end to call it.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
// ...existing code...
   (async () => {
        console.log("Initializing...");
        await initRunner(pages[urlLastPartFromLocation].actions.init);
   })();

    
});
```

how to read "user_id" hidden fields value on HttpPost method user

---

_**Assistant**_

To read the `user_id` hidden field value in your `User` `HttpPost` method, you can add a parameter to the method. ASP.NET Core's model binding will automatically populate this parameter with the value from the submitted form.

You can use the `[FromForm]` attribute to explicitly specify that the value comes from a form field.

Here's how you can modify your `User` method in `FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web/Controllers/AdminController.cs`:

```csharp
// ...existing code...
    [HttpPost("/user")]
    public IActionResult User([FromForm(Name = "user_id")] string userId)
    {
        // You can now access the value of the 'user_id' hidden field
        // through the 'userId' variable.
        Console.WriteLine($"The user id is: {userId}");
        
        return View();
    }
}
```

In the code above:
1.  I've added a `string userId` parameter to the `User` method.
2.  The `[FromForm(Name = "user_id")]` attribute tells ASP.NET Core to look for a form field named `user_id` in the incoming `POST` request and assign its value to the `userId` parameter.

Your corresponding HTML form should contain a hidden input field like this:
```html
<input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="some-user-id" />

Implement the method bodies. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Of course. Here are the implementations for the `GetStations` and `GetStation` methods in your `ServiceRepository` class. I'll use Dapper, which is already in use in this file, to query the database.

Based on your `script.sql` file, I'll assume "stations" correspond to the `queue` table.

```csharp
// ...existing code...
        public void DeleteToken(string tokenId)
        {
            using var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(_connectionString);
            conn.Open();
            conn.Execute("DELETE FROM token WHERE token_id = @TokenId", new { TokenId = tokenId });
        }


        public Queue[] GetStations()
        {
            const string sql = "SELECT * FROM public.queue;";
            using var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(_connectionString);
            return conn.Query<Queue>(sql).ToArray();
        }
        public Queue GetStation(long id)
        {
            const string sql = "SELECT * FROM public.queue WHERE queue_id = @id;";
            using var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(_connectionString);
            return conn.QueryFirstOrDefault<Queue>(sql, new { id });
        }
        
    }
}
```

I have made the following changes to `FrameworkQ.ConsularServices/Services/ServiceRepository.cs`:
1.  Implemented `GetStations()` to query all records from the `public.queue` table and return them as an array of `Queue` objects.
2.  Implemented `GetStation(long id)` to query for a single record from the `public.queue` table by its `queue_id` and return it as a `Queue` object.
3.  I also made the methods `public` to match the interface definition.

Create a class called  StationLog in FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Services namespace and folder and put proper column attributes. See ServiceInfo class and service_info table for conventions

---

_**Assistant**_

Of course. I will create the `StationLog.cs` file in the `` directory with properties that correspond to the `StationLog` table definition in your `script.sql` file, following the conventions from the `ServiceInfo` class. I have created the file `StationLog.cs` with the `StationLog` class.

The class has properties that correspond to the columns in the `StationLog` table in your `script.sql` file, and I've used `[Column]` attributes to map them correctly, just like in your `ServiceInfo` class. I've also added the `[Table("station_log")]` attribute to the class.

what attribute to use to map primary key

---

_**Assistant**_

To map a primary key in your `ServiceInfo.cs` (or any similar class), you should use the `[Key]` attribute from the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` namespace, along with the `[Column]` attribute to specify the column name in the database.

Here's how you would typically use it:

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

namespace FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Services;

public class ServiceInfo
{
    [Key]
    [Column("service_id")]
    public long ServiceId { get; set; }

    [Column("service_name")]
    public string ServiceName { get; set; }

    [Column("service_description")]
    public string ServiceDescription { get; set; }

    [Column("usual_service_days")]
    public int UsualServiceDays { get; set; }

    [Column("service_fee")]
    public double ServiceFee { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:

*   `[Key]` indicates that the `ServiceId` property is the primary key for the table.
*   `[Column("service_id")]` specifies that the `ServiceId` property maps to the `service_id` column in the database table.

Make sure to add `using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;` at the top of your file.

/fix 'Utils' does not contain a definition for 'GenerateSurveyJsConfigForItem'

---

_**Assistant**_

You should implement the missing static method 'GenerateSurveyJsConfigForItem' in the 'Utils' class to resolve the error.

```csharp
// Utility methods for the application
public static class Utils
{
    // Existing utility methods

    public static object GenerateSurveyJsConfigForItem(string itemtype)
    {
        // TODO: Replace with actual config generation logic
        return new { ItemType = itemtype, Config = "DefaultConfig" };
    }
}
```

   /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices/FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web/Views/Admin/User.cshtml(4,79): error CS0103: The name 'Context' does not exist in the current context

---

_**Assistant**_

The error "The name 'Context' does not exist in the current context" in your Razor view indicates that you're trying to access the `Context` object (which represents the HTTP context) in a place where it's not directly available. In Razor Pages, you typically access the HTTP context through the `HttpContext` property of the `PageModel`.

Since you're using a Razor Page (`@page` directive), you should access the request query parameters through the `PageModel`.

Here's how you can fix it:

1.  **Access `HttpContext` via the Model:**  Since you've declared `@model FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Pages.SecuredPage`, ensure that your `SecuredPage` class (or its base class) inherits from `PageModel` and exposes the `HttpContext`.

2.  **Modify the Razor View:**  Use `Model.HttpContext` to access the HTTP context and its request.

Here's the modified `User.cshtml` file:

```cshtml
@page
@model FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Pages.SecuredPage

@FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Utils.GenerateItemPageHiddenIdString("user", Model.HttpContext.Request.Query);

<div id="surveyContainer" style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="@FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Utils.MakeVersionable("/js/main.js")" ></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="@FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Utils.MakeVersionable("/js/admin.js")"></script>
```

And here's how your `SecuredPage` class should look (or a base class it inherits from):

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Pages
{
    public class SecuredPage : PageModel
    {
        public IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;
        public SecuredPage(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
        {
            _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
        }
        public HttpContext HttpContext => _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext;

        public virtual void OnGet()
        {
            // Your page logic here
        }
    }
}
```

Key changes:

*   Replaced `Context.Request.Query` with `Model.HttpContext.Request.Query`.
*   Ensured that `SecuredPage` inherits from `PageModel` and exposes the `HttpContext` via a property.

Make sure that you have registered `IHttpContextAccessor` in your `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
```

This setup ensures that your Razor Page has access to the HTTP context through the `Model` property.

 /Users/shafqat/git/ConsularServices/FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web/Views/SecuredPage.cs(7,14): error CS0534: 'SecuredPage' does not implement inherited abstract member 'RazorPageBase.ExecuteAsync()'

---

_**Assistant**_

You're encountering the error "CS0534: 'SecuredPage' does not implement inherited abstract member 'RazorPageBase.ExecuteAsync()'" because your `SecuredPage` class, which inherits from `RazorPage`, needs to implement the `ExecuteAsync()` method. This method is part of the `RazorPage`'s contract and is responsible for executing the Razor view.

Here's the corrected `SecuredPage.cs` file:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace FrameworkQ.ConsularServices.Web.Pages;

public class SecuredPage : PageModel
{
    public IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;

    public SecuredPage(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
    {
        _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
    }

    public HttpContext HttpContext => _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext;

    public virtual async Task<IActionResult> OnGetAsync()
    {
        return Page();
    }
}
```

Key changes and explanations:

*   **Inheritance from `PageModel`:**  I changed the inheritance from `Page` to `PageModel`.  `Page` is not the correct base class for Razor Pages. `PageModel` is the correct base class for Razor Pages.
*   **`OnGetAsync` Method:**  I've added an `OnGetAsync` method.  In Razor Pages, `OnGetAsync` (or `OnGet` for synchronous execution) is the method that handles HTTP GET requests to the page.  It's part of the `PageModel` lifecycle.
*   **Return `IActionResult`:** The `OnGetAsync` method returns an `IActionResult`, which allows you to return different types of results (e.g., a View, a Redirect, a JSON response, etc.).
*   **`return Page()`:**  Inside `OnGetAsync`, `return Page()` tells the Razor Pages framework to render the associated `.cshtml` file (your Razor view).
*   **`async Task`:**  The `async Task` return type allows you to perform asynchronous operations within the `OnGetAsync` method.

With these changes, your `SecuredPage` class now correctly implements the required methods for a Razor Page, and the CS0534 error should be resolved. Also, make sure that you have registered `IHttpContextAccessor` in your `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
```
